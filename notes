speed consideration: .0066 * speed bonus
drag cores up to middle to regulate speed up to what you've opened
fill cores to increase core level -- this will open the core oscillation
after 10 levels -- the cores pulse to indicate you can drop them -- pulse and translate down, pause then teleport to their max. They do this twice.
CORES Auto adjust based on score from previous round: > the current core expected level * score, they increase if possible. < threshhold of core expected level (.5 of next, maybe) -- they decrease if possible
CORES always increase after player fills screen with cores. 50 cores.
