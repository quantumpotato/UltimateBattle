new classes for battlefield, ships, bullets, etc.

qpbf {
it should {
  have 7 possible states: title, drawing, fighting, paused, scoring, weapon selection
  begin in title state
  not change state with an empty press
  change into drawing state when tapping on ship
 
drawing state {
  set offset from ship on press
  maintain in drawing state on a tick forward with no let up
  revert to paused state on tick forward with let up
 
use c arrays for delta x, delta y, delta fire.. less memory than objects
  store a delta of movement zero when touch doesnt move on tick
  store a delta x,y when point changes on next tick
  stop storing deltas when deltastack total exceeds max
  enter fighting state on let up
  enter fighting state when deltastack total exceeds max

fighting state {
  calculate speed with max speed cap and apply movement deltas on tick
  fire weapon on tap
  increase current iteration tick on tick
  enter paused state when current iteration reaches max movement deltas

paused state {
  delta stores should shift down to zero with difference equal to iteration difference
  erase deltastack and change into drawing state when tapping on ship
  maintain deltastack and change into drawing state when tapping on latest expected point (use function for latestx/y)
  set offset from ship on change into drawing state
  reset pathiterations when changing to drawing state from ship
  maintain pathiterations when changing to drawing state from latest pathpoint
  track total pauses used

fighting state{
  classes {quantumplayer, quantumclone)
  player fires weapon, bullets spawn
  clones copy deltas on kill

fighting state {
  enter scoring state on zero clones
  calculate time bonus
  calculate 10-paths used for multiplier pause bonus

scoring state {
..
}
   
fractals {
  bullets should draw fractally
  ships should draw fractally
  explosions should occur fractally
