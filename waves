bullet collision
bullet deflection (x vel swapping) (collision rule: modifier advances, replaces collision??)
ship momentum
ship control
ship gravity  well
reset layers && special weapons on tap:
 single stops/starts y vel
 wide swaps x vel
 shotgun turns around && resets pulses
 tight spiral slows?
 wide spiral accelerates x vel *+ n
complete: run through deadline
